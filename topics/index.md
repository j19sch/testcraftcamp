- test approach and strategy
- test techniques
- oracles and heuristics
- testability
- documentation
- note taking
- testing and agile, scrum, waterfall, XP, …
- automation in testing
- tools
- risk analysis
- storytelling
- modelling & visualisation
- user story refinement
- CI/CD
- communication skills
- collaboration skills
- test improvement
- testing games
- testing problems you need help with
- how to hire new testers
- AI and machine learning
- data driven software testing
- …

Be creative! Create your own session with the stuff you want to talk about, learn more about or let others help you solve a testing problem.
